# AirBnB clone
This project is the first part of the AirBnB clone (HBnB) project
from foundations year for Holberton School students.
The main objective of this project is to be an enrichment exerceise
to improve and applicate the most concepts of higher-level programing
done before and consists to do an specific command line interpreter
to manage all of the functions and features of our HBnB.

## Requirements of the project
To do this project we had to learn:
* How to create a Python package
* How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* How to manage datetime
* What is an UUID
* What is _*args_ and how to use it
* What is _**kwargs_ and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function
* How to do a unittest

## The console
This command line interpreter can:

* Manage objects: create, update, destroy, etc...
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc...
* Do some operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...)
* Update attributes of an object

# How to use?
### Getting started
At first, you have to clone this repository in your machine using this command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/santiagopemo/AirBnB_clone.git
```

Then, go inside it:
```bash
$ cd AirBnB_clone
```

Finally, you can use the console this way:
```bash
$ ./console.py
```
